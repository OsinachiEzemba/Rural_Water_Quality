# Rural_Water_Quality
Harnessing Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling to Enhance Water Quality Management in Catchment Areas of South-Africa.

**NOTE:** Due to the sensitive nature of this project, it is not possible to share the code publicly.

# Project Overview
**Project Aim:**
Assess water quality in catchment areas using available data like biomes, habitats, and settlements. The focus is on understanding data sources, quality, and strategy to guide municipalities in managing water systems, improving sampling efficiency, and preventing waterborne diseases.

**Ethical Considerations:**
Addressing bias in data

Deliverables
- Data Understanding and Preparation
- Conduct Data Coverage and Exploratory Data Analysis for each relevant dataset.
- Compile a Data Dictionary for each relevant dataset.
- Build a dashboard to assess water quality in catchment areas.
- Analyze seasonal trends and patterns in the data.
- Apply ML techniques to create predictive models.
- Establish secure and accessible data storage for relevant datasets.

**Importance of the Work:**
- Human health and wellbeing
- Relevant in South Africa due to challenges like insufficient sanitation infrastructure and industrial pollution.

**Focus of Output:**
- Guide municipalities in predicting pollution risks.
- Optimize sampling efforts to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

**Potential Users:**
- Government
- Environmentalists
- Engineers

  **Final Output:**
A demonstration of the application showcasing the successfully rural water quality model and its application, availing users with personalized interactions on viewing history counts of water quality and make future predictions about water quality.

**Conclusion:**
The Rural Water Quality Monitoring System aims to contribute significantly to water management and public health, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

**Recommendations**
- Collaborate with healthcare organizations to implement interventions based on water quality findings, especially in areas prone to waterborne diseases.
- Use the insights gained to contribute to the development or refinement of policies related to water quality and environmental conservation.
- Develop adaptive strategies considering changing environmental conditions, climate factors, and evolving pollution sources.
- Foster collaboration with government bodies, environmentalists, and engineers to share findings, improve strategies, and collectively address water quality challenges.
